# Lab 13 - Implement a cipher

ui.cpp : A simple menu system to call the ciphers

cipher.h : The base-class for all the ciphers

example.h : An example of a cipher. Please look at this file if you would like to know what needs to be done.

cipher01.h : Where the code for the first cipher goes.

cipher02.h : Where the code for the second cipher goes.

cipher03.h : Where the code for the third cipher goes.

cipher04.h : Where the code for the fourth cipher goes.

cipher05.h : Where the code for the fifth cipher goes.

cipher06.h : Where the code for the sixth cipher (if needed) goes.

cipher07.h : Where the code for the seventh cipher goes if there are seven members of your team.


## Getting Started

1. Compile and run the program with the example cipher to see how it works:

    `g++ ui.cpp`

    `./a.out`

2. Implement your cipher in one of the cipher files, cipher01.h through cipher07.h
