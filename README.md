# Lab 13 - Implement a cipher

ui.cpp : Code to run the user interface and the cipher

example.h : An example of a cipher. Please look at this file if you would like to know what needs to be done.

cipher.h : Base class that defines what a cipher is

cipher01.h : This is where you should implement your cipher



## Getting Started

1. Compile and run the program with the example cipher to see how it works:

    `g++ ui.cpp`

    `./a.out`

2. Implement your cipher in cipher01.h

3. Update ui.cpp so it runs your cipher
